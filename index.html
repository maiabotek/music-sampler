  <p id="mainParagraph"> Whether or not you realize it, there's a good chance you've probably heard a song by Aubrey Graham at some point in your life. Known by his stage name, Drake, the Canadian actor, entrepreneur and artist has dominated charts across multiple genres including hip-hop, R&B and pop. He's released over 140 singles, eight studio albums and numerous mixtapes, which have won him four Grammy Awards and 47 nominations. No matter your preference or taste in music, Drake offers songs to dance to, cry to or just relax to. His lyrics are often witty, though sometimes emotional, and the beats that accompany his vocals elevate his songs from other artists in the hip-hop genre. </p>
